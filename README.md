This website was designed to get real time weather updates. This website has a search bar feature that will save previous logged information (Example "Texas", "Utah" etc.) and give you real time weather updates on the location typed in. I am using "Open Weather API" for this webiste in order to get the weather, you can use the City name and State Codes for your search.
